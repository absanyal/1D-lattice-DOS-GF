# 1D-lattice-DOS-GF
Calculation of the DOS of two spinless fermions on a 1D lattice using many body Green Functions.

# Requirements
Requires python 3.5+, numpy package

# Instructions

IMPORTANT: The following will need to be hard-coded into each file as required.

1. Specify the interaction potential between the two fermions.
2. Specify the range of omega for which calculations are to be done.
3. Specify the number of k values over which calculations will run.
